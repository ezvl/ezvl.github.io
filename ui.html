    <p>At Luther, my studies required not only computer application but also mathematical algorithm courses. Such study gives me the groundwork I need to understand and promote coding skills. My courses in English, philosophy, economics, and other liberal arts studies provide me ways of thinking, learning and communicating that can help me become an effective employee in your organization.</p>
<p>As you can see from my enclosed resume, I worked for TriTech Software Systems as a software engineer intern for 7 months. Besides working on locating and fixing bugs, I gained knowledge and hands-on experience with C#, Angular JS, and SQL. Additionally, I founded and lead my own team named Toke to create animation and game products. This experience gave me the opportunity to work on a team and gain valuable experiences in making a software application. My demonstrated ability to act under pressure, set personal goals, and learn how to acquire new knowledge will help me succeed as a software developer.</p>
<p>I would appreciate the opportunity to further discuss how my skills and knowledge would benefit the company. My resume is enclosed for your review. You may contact me via my email at nguyla02@luther.edu. Please feel free to leave a message if I am not available. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward hearing from you soon.</p>
