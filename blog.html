		<h2> The Grand Canyon </h2>

		<p class="quote">What can be said about the Grand Canyon that hasn’t already been said? Formed over at least five million years as the Colorado River gradually cut its way through billions of years of Earth’s geological history, this is perennially one of the top travel destinations in the country. </p>
		<p>And why wouldn’t it be? It’s dramatic, and more than anything else, totally gorgeous. What’s even better is that you can enjoy it from the top or the bottom – hire a donkey to help get you down to the bottom and then float along the river, or marvel at its grandeur from above.</p>

		<h2>Arches National Park</h2>
		<img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.trailandhitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Arches-at-Night.jpg?resize=1000%2C652">
		<p class="quote">Millions of years of erosion have left fascinating geological structures across much of the American Southwest, although none are quite so impressive as the stone arches at Arches National Park.</p>
		<p> The rock is all sandstone, with its orange glow that looks so different depending on the light conditions in the area. The park is located in eastern Utah, outside of Moab. Environmental conditions are still taking their toll on the arches, though, and at least 43 have fallen since 1977. In order to limit the effects of humans, there are many arches that you can only view from far away.</p>
